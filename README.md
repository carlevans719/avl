TODO: 

- [ ] change markers to a line & do something about the awful implementation of the data stream
- [ ] check that the date query is behaving as expected - might be 1000x out
- [ ] implement "live follow"
- [ ] validate tcp input is matching f/e expectations
- [ ] figure out why prettier hates map.js


for the line - might be cool to have a series of arrowheads that form the line. Each one is oriented according to "heading". This way each element is still clickable to see things like speed and altitude
